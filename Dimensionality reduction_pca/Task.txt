Assignment
In this assignment and in the assignments in the following checkpoints, you'll work with the fashion MNIST dataset. This is another image dataset that comprises 70,000 grayscale 28x28 images. The dataset contains the following 10 classes:

T-shirt/top
Trouser/pants
Pullover shirt
Dress
Coat
Sandal
Shirt
Sneaker
Bag
Ankle boot
You can load the dataset using the fetch_openml function of sklearn.datasets as follows:

mnist = fetch_openml('Fashion-MNIST', version=1, cache=True)
Or, alternatively, you can download it from this link and load it yourself.

Randomly select 10,000 images, and work on this sample in the following exercises.

To complete this assignment, submit a link to a Jupyter Notebook that contains your solutions to the tasks outlined below. You can also take a look at these example solutions.

Load the dataset and conduct any necessary preprocessing, such as normalizing the data.
Apply PCA to the data and get the first two principal components.
Using the first two principal components, draw a graph of the data by coloring and labeling the data points as you did in the checkpoint.
Do you think that the PCA solution is satisfactory? Can you easily distinguish between the different classes?

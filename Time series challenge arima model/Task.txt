Challenge: Time series analysis
Using a different time series dataset (either from FRED or elsewhere), go about the process of time series modeling. Specifically, generate the following deliverables:

Plot the time series, along with any logical or necessary differences to get a stationary dataset.
Generate and interpret a PACF for the time series and discuss any differences in correlations.
Generate five ARIMA specifications and evaluate their efficacy at modeling your data.
Finally, choose one specification and make a case for it as a logical model for your dataset.
This should come in the form of a Notebook with descriptions that explain your process. Remember to use text, visuals, and analysis to tell a clear and concise story with your data.

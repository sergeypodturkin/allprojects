Assignment
In this assignment, you'll continue working with the fashion MNIST dataset. For the sake of comparability, use the same 10,000-observation sample that you used in the previous two checkpoints. To complete this assignment, submit a link to a Jupyter Notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks below. You can also take a look at these example solutions.

Load the dataset and conduct any necessary preprocessing, such as normalizing the data.
Apply UMAP to the data.
Using the two-dimensional UMAP representation, draw a graph of the data by coloring and labeling the data points as you did in the checkpoint.
Do you think that the UMAP solution is satisfactory? Can you easily distinguish between the different classes? Which algorithm produced better results, UMAP or the others (t-SNE or PCA) that you applied in the assignments from the previous checkpoints?
Now, play with the different hyperparameter values of the UMAP, and apply UMAP for each of them. Which combination is the best in terms of the two-dimensional representation clarity?

Hi Sergey! This is Zahra from the grading team. :)

Well done! You have made improvements based on the previous feedbacks and now passed this checkpoint.

üëç What you did well:

you have clearly explained about the project and your data set in introduction.
you have tried alternative methods for dimensional reduction data(t-SNE and UMAP ).
üí° Optional changes / Ideas / Improvements:

I would still have liked to see a bit more detail in your comparison of the different methods, clustering and DR methods. I would have liked to see a bit more detail in your discussion of how these unsupervised learning techniques (both clustering and dimensionality reduction) allowed you to gain insights about your data -- what did you learn about your data from applying these techniques?
You have incorporated some thorough adjustment and improvement on DR methods and DBSCAN method, along with adding an introduction and more text cells in your notebook. I hope you found this to be a beneficial process, as it really improves the quality of your overall project!

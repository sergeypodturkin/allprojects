Unsupervised learning is one of the major learning paradigms in machine learning. It enables data scientists to understand the patterns and relationships in the data without the guidance of ground truths in the data.

In the previous decades, many of the breakthroughs in machine learning came from the supervised learning front. But unsupervised learning remains one of the most promising directions that modern data science and artificial intelligence can make use of. Although you're living in a world with abundant amounts of data, labeling this data with ground truths is not an easy task; it often requires costly and challenging human labor. Unsupervised learning is of primary importance for data science because it has the potential to exploit enormous amounts of data without any need for annotation.

Challenge
In this module, you were introduced to the amazing and challenging domain of unsupervised learning; you explored some of the most popular clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Now, it's time for you to apply your unsupervised learning knowledge. In this challenge, you'll work with a dataset of your choice. As always, Kaggle will be one of your best friends. Spend some time on Kaggle and pick a beautiful dataset. Then, using that dataset, do the following:

Apply dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize the observations.
Apply clustering techniques to group similar observations.
For each of the tasks above, try several methods and select the best-performing one. Discuss how dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms enable you to gain insights regarding the data.

Assignment
In this assignment, you'll continue working with the heart disease dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

Load the dataset from Thinkful's database. To connect to the database, use these credentials:

postgres_user = 'dsbc_student'
postgres_pw = ''
postgres_host = '142.93.121.174'
postgres_port = '5432'
postgres_db = 'heartdisease'
The dataset needs some preprocessing. So, before working with the dataset, apply the following code:

# Define the features and the outcome
X = heartdisease_df.iloc[:, :13]
y = heartdisease_df.iloc[:, 13]

# Replace missing values (marked by `?`) with a `0`
X = X.replace(to_replace='?', value=0)

# Binarize y so that `1` means heart disease diagnosis and `0` means no diagnosis
y = np.where(y > 0,1, 0)
Here, X will represent your features and y will hold the labels. If y is equal to 1, that indicates that the corresponding patient has heart disease. And if y is equal to 0, then the patient doesn't have heart disease.

To complete this assignment, submit a link to a Jupyter Notebook containing your solutions to the following tasks below. You can also take a look at these example solutions.

Apply DBSCAN to the heart disease dataset by trying different values for the eps and min_samples parameters. You'll realize that it's really hard—if not impossible—to get a two-cluster solution using DBSCAN.
Apply DBSCAN by setting parameters eps=1, min_samples=1, metric="euclidean". Then increase the value of min_samples. When you increase the value of min_samples, how does that affect the number of clusters that DBSCAN identifies?

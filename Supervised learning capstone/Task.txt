You're ready to put into practice everything that you've learned so far. Here are the next steps for your capstone:

Go out and find a dataset of interest. It could be from one of the recommended resources or some other aggregation. Or it could be something that you scraped yourself. Just make sure that it has lots of variables, including an outcome of interest to you.

Explore the data. Get to know the data. Spend a lot of time going over its quirks. You should understand how it was gathered, what's in it, and what the variables look like.

Model your outcome of interest. You should try several different approaches and really work to tune a variety of models before using the model evaluation techniques to choose what you consider to be the best performer. Make sure to think about explanatory versus predictive power, and experiment with both.

Execute the three tasks above in a Jupyter Notebook that you will submit to the Thinkful team for grading.

Next, to prepare for your presentation, create a slide deck and a 15-minute presentation that guides viewers through your model. Be sure to cover a few specific topics:

A specified research question that your model addresses
How you chose your model specification and what alternatives you compared it to
The practical uses of your model for an audience of interest
Any weak points or shortcomings of your model
This presentation is not a drill. You'll be presenting this slide deck live to a group as the culmination of all your work so far on supervised learning. As a secondary matter, your slides and the Jupyter Notebook should be worthy of inclusion as examples of your work product when applying to jobs.

Good luck!
